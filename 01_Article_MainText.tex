Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,
but she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
but she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty’s a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeh,
someday I'm going to make her mine.

\subsection*{Delete from here to the next bit about figure call-outs}
You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it’s evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don’t you know you can count me out
Don’t you know it’s gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We’d all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We’re doing what we can
But when you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don’t you know it’s gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

You say you’ll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it’s the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain’t going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don’t you know know it’s gonna be alright?
Alright?
Alright?

Alright!

\subsection*{Another subsection}

She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she's hit the big time
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say.

Honey pie you are making me crazy 
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home.

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song.

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee.

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong.

Will the wind that blew her boat 
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home.

\subsection*{How to insert other call-outs}
Figures can also have a side caption like this (Figure \ref{fig:pam}).
If you want to reference a section you can do it like this (see \hyperref[s:methods]{Methods}).

This is how to do a call out to a supplementary video (Supplementary Video \ref{videosupp:julia}).
And this is how to reference a Supplementary Figure (Figure \ref{suppfig:blackbird}).

It is also possible to make a on-column figure and reference it like this (Figure \ref{fig:piggies}).

\begin{figure}[ht]

\section*{Discussion}\label{s:discussion}

In this paper, we described how we Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
I’m back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind.

I'm back in the U.S.S.R.
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaika’s ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm.
I'm back in the U.S.S.R. 
You don’t know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.

\subsection*{Molecular biology}

Details of plasmids are usually first.
Followed by cell biology section.
We have special units defied for molar and for units, e.g. \SI{1}{\Molar} sucrose, \SI{10}{\Units\per\milli\litre}.
Otherwise use siunitx for everything else. \SI{37}{\degreeCelsius} and what-not.

\subsection*{Cell biology}

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn’t like that
He said I’m gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon’s bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said, Doc it’s only a scratch
And I’ll be better I’ll be better doc as soon as I am able.

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon’s bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky’s revival.
