# manuscript-templates
LaTeX templates for manuscripts (switchable bioRxiv preprint and journal submission templates), for use on Overleaf. 

_This is a work in progress_

An ideal manuscript LaTeX template should be able to generate two versions of the manuscript:

1. a preprint version - typeset to look like a finished paper
2. a journal submission version - better for reviewing, with line numbers and different spacing, etc.

The ideal template should be able to switch between these two manuscript layouts.

The initial overleaf template was forked from Ricardo Henriques, who modified the PNAS template to create a really nice bioRxiv template. We have made a number of small changes to the bioRxiv template.
