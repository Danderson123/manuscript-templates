Identifying and understanding antimicrobial resistance are imperative for clinical practice to treat resistant infections and for public health efforts to limit the spread of resistance. Technologies such as next-generation sequencing are expanding our abilities to detect and study antimicrobial resistance. This Review provides a detailed overview of antimicrobial resistance identification and characterization methods, from traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing to recent deep-learning methods. We focus on sequencing-based resistance discovery and discuss tools and databases used in antimicrobial resistance studies. Next-generation sequencing has improved the identification and characterization of antimicrobial resistance. Focusing on sequence-based discovery of antibiotic resistance genes, this Review discusses computational strategies and resources for resistance gene identification in genomic and metagenomic samples, including recent deep-learning approaches.}},

The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution. A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data. Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources, its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration on standard desktop systems.

However, the effect of short-read depth on polishing performance is not well understood.

We then show that: (1) all polishers other than Pypolca-careful, Polypolish-default and Polypolish-careful commonly introduce false-positive errors at low read depth; (2) most of the benefit of short-read polishing occurs by 25× depth; (3) Polypolish-careful almost never introduces false-positive errors at any depth; and (4) Pypolca-careful is the single most effective polisher. Overall, we recommend the following polishing strategies: Polypolish-careful alone when depth is very low (&lt;5×), Polypolish-careful and Pypolca-careful when depth is low (5–25×), and Polypolish-default and Pypolca-careful when depth is sufficient (&gt;25×).",

  abstract  = {Long-read single-molecule sequencing has revolutionized de novo genome assembly and enabled the automated reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and achieves a contig NG50 of >21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila melanogaster PacBio data sets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly (GFA) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.}

For \textit{S. aureus}, the error rates of our method are comparable to gold-standard phenotypic methods, with sensitivity/specificity of 99.1\%/99.6\% across 12 antibiotics (using an independent validation set, n=470). For \textit{M. tuberculosis}, our method predicts resistance with sensitivity/specificity of 82.6\%/98.5\% (independent validation set, n=1,609); sensitivity is lower here, probably because of limited understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms. We give evidence that minor alleles improve detection of extremely drug-resistant strains, and demonstrate feasibility of the use of emerging single-molecule nanopore sequencing techniques for these purposes.},

Since 2017, CARD has expanded through extensive curation of reference sequences, revision of the ontological structure, curation of over 500 new AMR detection models, development of a new classification paradigm and expansion of analytical tools. Most notably, a new Resistomes \& Variants module provides analysis and statistical summary of in silico predicted resistance variants from 82 pathogens and over 100 000 genomes. By adding these resistance variants to CARD, we are able to summarize predicted resistance using the information included in CARD, identify trends in AMR mobility and determine previously undescribed and novel resistance variants.

  abstract  = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant public health threat. With the rise of affordable whole genome sequencing, in silico approaches to assessing AMR gene content can be used to detect known resistance mechanisms and potentially identify novel mechanisms. To enable accurate assessment of AMR gene content, as part of a multi-agency collaboration, NCBI developed a comprehensive AMR gene database, the Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Gene Database and the AMR gene detection tool AMRFinder. Here, we describe the expansion of the Reference Gene Database, now called the Reference Gene Catalog, to include putative acid, biocide, metal, stress resistance genes, in addition to virulence genes and species-specific point mutations. Genes and point mutations are classified by broad functions, as well as more detailed functions. As we have expanded both the functional repertoire of identified genes and functionality, NCBI released a new version of AMRFinder, known as AMRFinderPlus. This new tool allows users the option to utilize only the core set of AMR elements, or include stress response and virulence genes, too. AMRFinderPlus can detect acquired genes and point mutations in both protein and nucleotide sequence. In addition, the evidence used to identify the gene has been expanded to include whether nucleotide or protein sequence was used, its location in the contig, and presence of an internal stop codon. These database improvements and functional expansions will enable increased precision in identifying AMR genes, linking AMR genotypes and phenotypes, and determining possible relationships between AMR, virulence, and stress response.}

Here, we introduce Bakta, a new command-line software tool for the robust, taxon-independent, thorough and, nonetheless, fast annotation of bacterial genomes. Bakta conducts a comprehensive annotation workflow including the detection of small proteins taking into account replicon metadata. The annotation of coding sequences is accelerated via an alignment-free sequence identification approach that in addition facilitates the precise assignment of public database cross-references. Annotation results are exported in GFF3 and International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)-compliant flat files, as well as comprehensive JSON files, facilitating automated downstream analysis. We compared Bakta to other rapid contemporary command-line annotation software tools in both targeted and taxonomically broad benchmarks including isolates and metagenomic-assembled genomes. We demonstrated that Bakta outperforms other tools in terms of functional annotations, the assignment of functional categories and database cross-references, whilst providing comparable wall-clock runtimes. Bakta is implemented in Python 3 and runs on MacOS and Linux systems. It is freely available under a GPLv3 license at https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta. An accompanying web version is available at https://bakta.computational.bio.}

However, analysing plasmid content remains difficult due to incomplete assembly of plasmids. Bacterial isolates can contain any number of plasmids and assembly remains complicated due to the presence of repetitive elements. Numerous tools have been developed to analyse plasmids but the performance and functionality of the tools are variable. The MOB-suite was developed as a set of modular tools for reconstruction and typing of plasmids from draft assembly data to facilitate characterization of plasmids. Using a set of closed genomes with publicly available Illumina data, the MOB-suite identified contigs of plasmid origin with both high sensitivity and specificity (95 and 88 %, respectively). In comparison, plasmidfinder demonstrated high specificity (99 %) but limited sensitivity (50 %). Using the same dataset of 377 known plasmids, MOB-recon accurately reconstructed 207 plasmids so that they were assigned to a single grouping without other plasmid or chromosomal sequences, whereas plasmidSPAdes was only able to accurately reconstruct 102 plasmids. In general, plasmidSPAdes has a tendency to merge different plasmids together, with 208 plasmids undergoing merge events. The MOB-suite reduces the number of errors but produces more hybrid plasmids, with 84 plasmids undergoing both splits and merges. The MOB-suite also provides replicon typing similar to plasmidfinder but with the inclusion of relaxase typing and prediction of conjugation potential. The MOB-suite is written in Python 3 and is available from https://github.com/phac-nml/mob-suite.",

We benchmark Flye against five state-of-the-art assemblers and show that it generates better or comparable assemblies, while being an order of magnitude faster.

In this study, we compared these two approaches for bacterial whole-genome sequencing, with a specific aim of assessing their ability to recover small plasmid sequences. To do so, we sequenced DNA from seven plasmid-rich bacterial isolates in three different ways: ONT ligation, ONT rapid and Illumina. Using the Illumina read depths to approximate true plasmid abundance, we found that small plasmids (<20 kbp) were underrepresented in ONT ligation read sets (by a mean factor of \textbackslashtextasciitilde4) but were not underrepresented in ONT rapid read sets. This effect correlated with plasmid size, with the smallest plasmids being the most underrepresented in ONT ligation read sets. We also found lower rates of chimaeric reads in the rapid read sets relative to ligation read sets. These results show that when small plasmid recovery is important, ONT rapid library preparations are preferable to ligation-based protocols.}},

The class A beta-lactamase blaTEM-1 is often carried by co-amoxiclav-resistant pathogens, but exhibits high phenotypic heterogeneity, making genotype-phenotype predictions challenging. We present a curated dataset of n=377 E. coli isolates representing all 8 known phylogroups, where the only acquired beta-lactamase is blaTEM-1. For all isolates, we generate hybrid assemblies and co-amoxiclav MICs, and for a subset (n=67/377), blaTEM-1 qPCR expression data. First, we test whether certain E. coli lineages are intrinsically better or worse at expressing blaTEM-1, for example, due to lineage differences in regulatory systems, which are challenging to directly quantify. Using genotypic features of the isolates (blaTEM-1 promoter variants and copy number), we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for blaTEM-1 expression that controls for phylogeny. We establish that blaTEM-1 expression intrinsically varies across the phylogeny, with some lineages (e.g. phylogroups B1 and C, ST12) better at expression than others (e.g. phylogroups E and F, ST372). Next, we test whether phylogenetic variation in expression influences the resistance of the isolates. With a second model, we use genotypic features (blaTEM-1 promoter variants, copy number, duplications; ampC promoter variants; efflux pump AcrF presence) to predict isolate MIC, again controlling for phylogeny. Lastly, we use a third model to demonstrate that the phylogenetic influence on blaTEM-1 expression causally drives the variation in co-amoxiclav MIC. This underscores the importance of incorporating phylogeny into genotype-phenotype predictions, and the study of resistance more generally.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract  = {Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing has rich potential for genomic epidemiology and public health investigations of bacterial pathogens, particularly in low-resource settings and at the point of care, due to its portability and affordability. However, low base-call accuracy has limited the reliability of ONT data for critical tasks such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence gene detection and typing, serotype prediction, and cluster identification. Thus, Illumina sequencing remains the standard for genomic surveillance despite higher capital and running costs. We tested the accuracy of ONT-only assemblies for common applied bacterial genomics tasks (genotyping and cluster detection, implemented via Kleborate, Kaptive and Pathogenwatch), using data from 54 unique Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. ONT reads generated via MinION with R9.4.1 flowcells were basecalled using three alternative models [Fast, High-accuracy (HAC) and Super-accuracy (SUP), available within ONT's Guppy software], assembled with Flye and polished using Medaka. Accuracy of typing using ONT-only assemblies was compared with that of Illumina-only and hybrid ONT+Illumina assemblies, constructed from the same isolates as reference standards. The most resource-intensive ONT-assembly approach (SUP basecalling, with or without Medaka polishing) performed best, yielding reliable capsule (K) type calls for all strains (100% exact or best matching locus), reliable multi-locus sequence type (MLST) assignment (98.3% exact match or single-locus variants), and good detection of acquired AMR genes and mutations (88-100% correct identification across the various drug classes). Distance-based trees generated from SUP+Medaka assemblies accurately reflected overall genetic relationships between isolates. The definition of outbreak clusters from ONT-only assemblies was problematic due to inflation of SNP counts by high base-call errors. However, ONT data could be reliably used to 'rule out' isolates of distinct lineages from suspected transmission clusters. HAC basecalling + Medaka polishing performed similarly to SUP basecalling without polishing. Therefore, we recommend investing compute resources into basecalling (SUP model), wherever compute resources and time allow, and note that polishing is also worthwhile for improved performance. Overall, our results show that MLST, K type and AMR determinants can be reliably identified with ONT-only R9.4.1 flowcell data. However, cluster detection remains challenging with this technology.},

We challenged populations of Escherichia coli carrying the blaTEM-1 β-lactamase gene on either the chromosome or a multicopy plasmid (19 copies per cell) with increasing concentrations of ceftazidime. The plasmid accelerated resistance evolution by increasing the rate of appearance of novel TEM-1 mutations, thereby conferring resistance to ceftazidime, and then by amplifying the effect of TEM-1 mutations due to the increased gene dosage. Crucially, this dual effect was necessary and sufficient for the evolution of clinically relevant levels of resistance. Subsequent evolution occurred by mutations in a regulatory RNA that increased the plasmid copy number, resulting in marginal gains in ceftazidime resistance. These results uncover a role for multicopy plasmids as catalysts for the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.},

To test whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) could provide a more reliable assessment of susceptibility than traditional methods, we predicted resistance from WGS for 976 Escherichia coli bloodstream infection isolates from Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, comparing against phenotypes from the BD Phoenix (calibrated against EUCAST guidelines). A total of 339/976 (35\%) isolates were amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant. Predictions based solely on beta-lactamase presence/absence performed poorly (sensitivity, 23\% [78/339]) but improved when genetic features associated with penicillinase hyperproduction (e.g., promoter mutations and copy number estimates) were considered (sensitivity, 82\% [277/339]; P < 0.0001). Most discrepancies occurred in isolates with MICs within ±1 doubling dilution of the breakpoint. We investigated two potential causes: the phenotypic reference and the binary resistant/susceptible classification. We performed reference standard, replicated phenotyping in a random stratified subsample of 261/976 (27\%) isolates using agar dilution, following both EUCAST and CLSI guidelines, which use different clavulanate concentrations. As well as disagreeing with each other, neither agar dilution phenotype aligned perfectly with genetic features. A random-effects model investigating associations between genetic features and MICs showed that some genetic features had small, variable and additive effects, resulting in variable resistance classification. Using model fixed-effects to predict MICs for the non-agar dilution isolates, predicted MICs were in essential agreement (±1 doubling dilution) with observed (BD Phoenix) MICs for 691/715 (97\%) isolates. This suggests amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance in E. coli is quantitative, rather than qualitative, explaining the poorly reproducible binary (resistant/susceptible) phenotypes and suboptimal concordance between different phenotypic methods and with WGS-based predictions.}},

    abstract = {{Background Pairwise single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a cornerstone of genomic approaches to the inference of transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms in hospitals. However, the impact of many key analytical approaches on these inferences has not yet been systematically assessed. This study aims to make such a systematic assessment. Methods We conducted a 15-month prospective study (2-month pilot phase, 13-month implementation phase), across four hospital networks including eight hospitals in Melbourne, VIC, Australia. Patient clinical and screening samples containing one or more isolates of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were collected and underwent whole genome sequencing. Using the genome data from the top four most numerous sequence types from each species, 16 in total, we systematically assessed the: (1) impact of sample and reference genome diversity through multiple core genome alignments using different data subsets and reference genomes, (2) effect of masking of prophage and regions of recombination in the core genome alignments by assessing SNP distances before and after masking, (3) differences between a cumulative versus a 3-month sliding-window approach to sample genome inclusion in the dataset over time, and (4) the comparative effects each of these approaches had when applying a previously defined SNP threshold for inferring likely transmission. Findings 2275 samples were collected (397 during the pilot phase from April 4 to June 18, 2017; 1878 during the implementation phase from Oct 30, 2017, to Nov 30, 2018) from 1870 patients. Of these 2275 samples, 1537 were identified as arising from the four most numerous sequence types from each of the four target species of MDR organisms in this dataset (16 sequence types in total: S aureus ST5, ST22, ST45, and ST93; E faecium ST80, ST203, ST1421, and ST1424; K pneumoniae ST15, ST17, ST307, and ST323; and E coli ST38, ST131, ST648, and ST1193). Across the species, using a reference genome of the same sequence type provided a greater degree of pairwise SNP resolution, compared with species and outgroup-reference alignments that mostly resulted in inflated SNP distances and the possibility of missed transmission events. Omitting prophage regions had minimal effect; however, omitting recombination regions had a highly variable effect, often inflating the number of closely related pairs. Estimated SNP distances between isolate pairs over time were more consistent using a sliding-window than a cumulative approach. Interpretation We propose that the use of a closely related reference genome, without masking of prophage or recombination regions, and of a sliding-window approach for isolate inclusion is best for accurate and consistent MDR organism transmission inference, when using core genome alignments and SNP thresholds. These approaches provide increased stability and resolution, so SNP thresholds can be more reliably applied for putative transmission inference among diverse MDR organisms, reducing the chance of incorrectly inferring the presence or absence of close genetic relatedness and, therefore, transmission. The establishment of a broadly applicable and standardised approach, as proposed here, is necessary to implement widespread prospective genomic surveillance for MDR organism transmission.

  abstract  = {Common culturing techniques and priorities bias our discovery towards specific traits that may not be representative of microbial diversity in nature. So far, these biases have not been systematically examined. To address this gap, here we use 116,884 publicly available metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs, completeness ≥80\%) from 203 surveys worldwide as a culture-independent sample of bacterial and archaeal diversity, and compare these MAGs to the popular RefSeq genome database, which heavily relies on cultures. We compare the distribution of 12,454 KEGG gene orthologs (used as trait proxies) in the MAGs and RefSeq genomes, while controlling for environment type (ocean, soil, lake, bioreactor, human, and other animals). Using statistical modeling, we then determine the conditional probabilities that a species is represented in RefSeq depending on its genetic repertoire. We find that the majority of examined genes are significantly biased for or against in RefSeq. Our systematic estimates of gene prevalences across bacteria and archaea in nature and gene-specific biases in reference genomes constitutes a resource for addressing these issues in the future.}

  abstract  = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global public health threat, which has been largely driven by the excessive use of antimicrobials. Control measures are urgently needed to slow the trajectory of AMR but are hampered by an incomplete understanding of the interplay between pathogens, AMR encoding genes, and mobile genetic elements at a microbial level. These factors, combined with the human, animal, and environmental interactions that underlie AMR dissemination at a population level, make for a highly complex landscape. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and, more recently, metagenomic analyses have greatly enhanced our understanding of these processes, and these approaches are informing mitigation strategies for how we better understand and control AMR. This review explores how WGS techniques have advanced global, national, and local AMR surveillance, and how this improved understanding is being applied to inform solutions, such as novel diagnostic methods that allow antimicrobial use to be optimised and vaccination strategies for better controlling AMR. We highlight some future opportunities for AMR control informed by genomic sequencing, along with the remaining challenges that must be overcome to fully realise the potential of WGS approaches for international AMR control.}

Long-read sequencing greatly assists with resolving complex bacterial genomes, particularly when combined with short-read Illumina data (hybrid assembly). However, it is not clear how different long-read sequencing methods affect hybrid assembly accuracy. Relative automation of the assembly process is also crucial to facilitating high-throughput complete bacterial genome reconstruction, avoiding multiple bespoke filtering and data manipulation steps. In this study, we compared hybrid assemblies for 20 bacterial isolates, including two reference strains, using Illumina sequencing and long reads from either Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing platforms. We chose isolates from the family Enterobacteriaceae, as these frequently have highly plastic, repetitive genetic structures, and complete genome reconstruction for these species is relevant for a precise understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. We de novo assembled genomes using the hybrid assembler Unicycler and compared different read processing strategies, as well as comparing to long-read-only assembly with Flye followed by short-read polishing with Pilon. Hybrid assembly with either PacBio or ONT reads facilitated high-quality genome reconstruction, and was superior to the long-read assembly and polishing approach evaluated with respect to accuracy and completeness. Combining ONT and Illumina reads fully resolved most genomes without additional manual steps, and at a lower consumables cost per isolate in our setting. Automated hybrid assembly is a powerful tool for complete and accurate bacterial genome assembly.}},

(i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

ABSTRACT 
The objectives of this study were to identify antimicrobial resistance genotypes for Campylobacter and to evaluate the correlation between resistance phenotypes and genotypes using in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). A total of 114 Campylobacter species isolates (82 C. coli and 32 C. jejuni) obtained from 2000 to 2013 from humans, retail meats, and cecal samples from food production animals in the United States as part of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System were selected for study. Resistance phenotypes were determined using broth microdilution of nine antimicrobials. Genomic DNA was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, and resistance genotypes were identified using assembled WGS sequences through blastx analysis. Eighteen resistance genes, including tet(O), bla
OXA-61, catA, lnu(C), aph(2″)-Ib, aph(2″)-Ic, aph(2′)-If, aph(2″)-Ig, aph(2″)-Ih, aac(6′)-Ie-aph(2″)-Ia, aac(6′)-Ie-aph(2″)-If, aac(6′)-Im, aadE, sat4, ant(6′), aad9, aph(3′)-Ic, and aph(3′)-IIIa, and mutations in two housekeeping genes (gyrA and 23S rRNA) were identified. There was a high degree of correlation between phenotypic resistance to a given drug and the presence of one or more corresponding resistance genes. Phenotypic and genotypic correlation was 100\% for tetracycline, ciprofloxacin/nalidixic acid, and erythromycin, and correlations ranged from 95.4\% to 98.7\% for gentamicin, azithromycin, clindamycin, and telithromycin. All isolates were susceptible to florfenicol, and no genes associated with florfenicol resistance were detected. There was a strong correlation (99.2\%) between resistance genotypes and phenotypes, suggesting that WGS is a reliable indicator of resistance to the nine antimicrobial agents assayed in this study. WGS has the potential to be a powerful tool for antimicrobial resistance surveillance programs.
