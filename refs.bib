Knocking down the endogenous subunit with siRNA, and then adding rapamycin, caused the APs to be rerouted to mitochondria within seconds. Rerouting AP-2 to mitochondria effectively abolished clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin. In cells with rerouted AP-1, endocytosed cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) accumulated in a peripheral compartment, and isolated CCVs had reduced levels of CIMPR, but normal levels of the lysosomal hydrolase DNase II. Both observations support a role for AP-1 in retrograde trafficking. This type of approach, which we call a "knocksideways," should be widely applicable as a means of inactivating proteins with a time scale of seconds or minutes rather than days.},

Our initial experiments suggested that TPD54 has a role in anterograde membrane traffic and in the recycling of endocytosed proteins back to the cell surface. To understand how TPD54 controls these diverse functions, we used an inducible method to reroute TPD54 to mitochondria. Surprisingly, this manipulation resulted in the capture of many functional vesicles (30 nm diameter) at the mitochondrial surface. To investigate the identity of captured vesicles, we did a rerouting screen using TPD54 as bait and the Rab GTPases as prey. This screen revealed that TPD54 associates promiscuously with at least 16 out of 43 different Rab GTPases. Our data suggest that TPD54 binds as an effector protein to Rabs involved in anterograde traffic and recycling.},

Using tissue-specific and inducible promoters in combination with functional GFP-fusion proteins, we demonstrate that zGrad can inactivate transmembrane, cytosolic and nuclear proteins globally, locally and temporally with different consequences. Global protein depletion results in phenotypes similar to loss of gene activity while local and temporal protein inactivation yields more restricted and novel phenotypes. Thus, zGrad is a versatile tool to study the spatial and temporal requirement of proteins in zebrafish.},

Another approach for directed protein degradation are anti-GFP nanobodies, which can be applied to GFP stock collections that are readily available in different experimental models. Here, we combine the advantages of auxin and nanobody-based degradation technologies creating an AID-nanobody to degrade GFP-tagged proteins at different cellular structures in a conditional and reversible manner in human cells. We demonstrate efficient and reversible inactivation of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and thus provide new means to study the functions of this essential ubiquitin E3 ligase.

It is traceable, because the GFP tag can be used to monitor the protein knockout.

We leverage the widespread availability of fluorescently labelled proteins to visualize and manipulate intracellular signalling pathways in live cells by using nanobodies targeting fluorescent protein tags.
Results: We generated a toolkit of plasmids encoding nanobodies against red and green fluorescent proteins (RFP and GFP variants), fused to functional modules. These include fluorescent sensors for visualization of Ca2+, H+ and ATP/ADP dynamics; oligomerizing or heterodimerizing modules that allow recruitment or sequestration of proteins and identification of membrane contact sites between organelles; SNAP tags that allow labelling with fluorescent dyes and targeted chromophore-assisted light inactivation; and nanobodies targeted to lumenal sub-compartments of the secretory pathway. We also developed two methods for crosslinking tagged proteins: a dimeric nanobody, and RFP-targeting and GFP-targeting nanobodies fused to complementary hetero-dimerizing domains. We show various applications of the toolkit and demonstrate, for example, that IP3 receptors deliver Ca2+ to the outer membrane of only a subset of mitochondria, and that only one or two sites on a mitochondrion form membrane contacts with the plasma membrane.
Conclusions: This toolkit greatly expands the utility of intrabodies for studying cell signalling in live cells.},

Indeed, current methods (using cell-penetrating peptides for instance) provide very low yields: QDs stay at the plasma membrane or are trapped in endosomes. Here, we introduce a technology based on cell-penetrating poly(disulfide)s that solves this problem: we deliver about 70 QDs per cell, and 90\% appear to freely diffuse in the cytosol. Furthermore, these QDs can be functionalized, carrying GFP or anti-GFP nanobodies for instance.

	abstract = {During asymmetric division, fate determinants at the cell cortex segregate unequally into the two daughter cells. It has recently been shown that Sara (Smad anchor for receptor activation) signalling endosomes in the cytoplasm also segregate asymmetrically during asymmetric division. Biased dispatch of Sara endosomes mediates asymmetric Notch/Delta signalling during the asymmetric division of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila. In flies, this has been generalized to stem cells in the gut and the central nervous system, and, in zebrafish, to neural precursors of the spinal cord. However, the mechanism of asymmetric endosome segregation is not understood. Here we show that the plus-end kinesin motor Klp98A targets Sara endosomes to the central spindle, where they move bidirectionally on an antiparallel array of microtubules. The microtubule depolymerizing kinesin Klp10A and its antagonist Patronin generate central spindle asymmetry. This asymmetric spindle, in turn, polarizes endosome motility, ultimately causing asymmetric endosome dispatch into one daughter cell. We demonstrate this mechanism by inverting the polarity of the central spindle by polar targeting of Patronin using nanobodies (single-domain antibodies). This spindle inversion targets the endosomes to the wrong cell. Our data uncover the molecular and physical mechanism by which organelles localized away from the cellular cortex can be dispatched asymmetrically during asymmetric division.},

Taking advantage of the massive flow of ribosomal proteins through the nucleus during maturation, a protein of the large subunit was chosen as the anchor. Addition of rapamycin, due to formation of the ternary complex, composed of the anchor, rapamycin, and the target, then results in the rapid depletion of the target from the nucleus. All 43 tested genes displayed on rapamycin plates the expected defective growth phenotype. In addition, when examined functionally, specific mutant phenotypes were obtained within minutes. These are genes involved in protein import, RNA export, transcription, sister chromatid cohesion, and gene silencing. The AA technique is a powerful tool for nuclear biology to dissect the function of individual or gene pairs in synthetic, lethal situations.},

The GBP allows a fast and efficient (one-step) isolation of GFP fusion proteins and their interacting factors for biochemical analyses including mass spectroscopy and enzyme activity measurements. Moreover GBP is also suitable for chromatin immunoprecipitations from cells expressing fluorescent DNA-binding proteins. Most importantly, GBP can be fused with cellular proteins to ectopically recruit GFP fusion proteins allowing targeted manipulation of cellular structures and processes in living cells. Because of the high affinity capture of GFP fusion proteins in vitro and in vivo and a size in the lower nanometer range we refer to the immobilized GFP-binding protein as GFP-nanotrap.

The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-binding protein, GBP, is a 13-kDa soluble protein derived from a llama heavy chain antibody that binds with high affinity to GFP as well as to some GFP variants such as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). A GBP fusion to the red fluorescent protein (RFP), a molecule termed a chromobody, was previously used to trace in vivo the localization of various animal antigens. In this study, we extend the use of chromobody technology to plant cells and develop several applications for the in vivo study of GFP-tagged plant proteins. We took advantage of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression assays (agroinfiltration) and virus expression vectors (agroinfection) to express functional GBP:RFP fusion (chromobody) in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. We showed that the chromobody is effective in binding GFP- and YFP-tagged proteins in planta. Most interestingly, GBP:RFP can be applied to interfere with the function of GFP fusion protein and to mislocalize (trap) GFP fusions to the plant cytoplasm in order to alter the phenotype mediated by the targeted proteins. Chromobody technology, therefore, represents a new alternative technique for protein interference that can directly link localization of plant proteins to in vivo function.},

To date, we have generated multiple hiPSC lines with monoallelic green fluorescent protein tags labeling 10 proteins representing major cellular structures. The tagged proteins include alpha tubulin, beta actin, desmoplakin, fibrillarin, nuclear lamin B1, nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIB, paxillin, Sec61 beta, tight junction protein ZO1, and Tom20. Our genome-editing methodology using Cas9/crRNA ribonuclear protein and donor plasmid coelectroporation, followed by fluorescence-based enrichment of edited cells, typically resulted in {\textless}0.1-4\% homology-directed repair (HDR). Twenty-five percent of clones generated from each edited population were precisely edited. Furthermore, 92\% (36/39) of expanded clonal lines displayed robust morphology, genomic stability, expression and localization of the tagged protein to the appropriate subcellular structure, pluripotency-marker expression, and multilineage differentiation. It is our conclusion that, if cell lines are confirmed to harbor an appropriate gene edit, pluripotency, differentiation potential, and genomic stability are typically maintained during the clonal line-generation process. The data described here reveal general trends that emerged from this systematic gene-tagging approach. Final clonal lines corresponding to each of the 10 cellular structures are now available to the research community.},

Our FTFLP-based approach offers two significant advantages: first, it produces internally-tagged full-length proteins that are likely to exhibit native intracellular localization, and second, it yields information about the tissue specificity of gene expression by the use of native promoters.

Previous live-cell imaging studies using ectopically overexpressed fluorescent fusions of endocytic proteins indicated that mammalian CME is a highly dynamic but inefficient and heterogeneous process. In contrast, studies of endocytosis in budding yeast using fluorescent protein fusions expressed at physiological levels from native genomic loci have revealed a process that is very regular and efficient. To analyse endocytic dynamics in mammalian cells in which endogenous protein stoichiometry is preserved, we targeted zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) to the clathrin light chain A and dynamin-2 genomic loci and generated cell lines expressing fluorescent protein fusions from each locus. The genome-edited cells exhibited enhanced endocytic function, dynamics and efficiency when compared with previously studied cells, indicating that CME is highly sensitive to the levels of its protein components. Our study establishes that ZFN-mediated genome editing is a robust tool for expressing protein fusions at endogenous levels to faithfully report subcellular localization and dynamics.},

Instead, EAP function is best studied by uncovering the correlation between variations in EAP association to individual CCPs and the resulting variations in maturation. However, most EAPs bind to CCPs in low numbers, making the measurement of EAP association via fused fluorescent reporters highly susceptible to detection errors. Here, we present a framework for unbiased measurement of EAP recruitment to CCPs and their direct effects on CCP dynamics.

Unlike conventional antibodies, the small, stable nanobodies are functional in living cells. Nanobody-induced changes were detected by ratio imaging and used to monitor protein expression and subcellular localization as well as translocation events such as the tamoxifen-induced nuclear localization of estrogen receptor.

Three properties of dynamin are strongly supported by experimental data: first, dynamin oligomerizes into a helical polymer; second, dynamin oligomer constricts in the presence of GTP; and third, dynamin catalyzes membrane fission upon GTP hydrolysis.

Potassium depletion, as well as incubation in hypertonic medium, remove membrane-associated clathrin lattices: flat clathrin lattices and coated pits from the plasma membrane, and clathrin-coated vesicles from the cytoplasm, as well as those budding from the TGN. In contrast, immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies specific for the alpha- and beta-adaptins, respectively, and immunogold labeling of cryosections with anti-alpha-adaptin antibodies shows that under these conditions HA2 adaptors are aggregated at the plasma membrane to the same extent as in control cells. After reconstitution with isotonic K(+)-containing medium, adaptor aggregates and clathrin lattices colocalize at the plasma membrane as normally and internalization of transferrin resumes. Acidification of the cytosol affects neither clathrin nor HA2 adaptors as studied by immunofluorescence microscopy. However, quantitative ultrastructural observations reveal that acidification of the cytosol results in formation of heterogeneously sized and in average smaller clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane and buds on the TGN. Collectively, our observations indicate that the methods to perturb formation of clathrin-coated vesicles act by different mechanisms: acidification of the cytosol by affecting clathrin-coated membrane domains in a way that interferes with budding of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane as well as from the TGN; potassium depletion and incubation in hypertonic medium by preventing clathrin and adaptors from interacting. Furthermore our observations show that adaptor aggregates can exist at the plasma membrane independent of clathrin lattices and raise the possibility that adaptor aggregates can form nucleation sites for clathrin lattices.},

	abstract = {In addition to the popular method of fluorescent protein fusion, live cell protein imaging has now seen more and more application of epitope tags. The small size of these tags may reduce functional perturbation and enable signal amplification. To address their background issue, we adapt self-complementing split fluorescent proteins as epitope tags for live cell protein labelling. The two tags, GFP11 and sfCherry11 are derived from the eleventh $\beta$-strand of super-folder GFP and sfCherry, respectively. The small size of FP11-tags enables a cost-effective and scalable way to insert them into endogenous genomic loci via CRISPR-mediated homology-directed repair. Tandem arrangement FP11-tags allows proportional enhancement of fluorescence signal in tracking intraflagellar transport particles, or reduction of photobleaching for live microtubule imaging. Finally, we show the utility of tandem GFP11-tag in scaffolding protein oligomerization. These experiments illustrate the versatility of FP11-tag as a labelling tool as well as a multimerization-control tool for both imaging and non-imaging applications.},

	abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are crucial for cellular homeostasis and play important roles in the dynamic execution of biological processes. While antibodies represent a well-established tool to study protein interactions of extracellular domains and secreted proteins, as well as in fixed and permeabilized cells, they usually cannot be functionally expressed in the cytoplasm of living cells. Non-immunoglobulin protein-binding scaffolds have been identified that also function intracellularly and are now being engineered for synthetic biology applications. Here we used the Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) scaffold to generate binders to fluorescent proteins and used them to modify biological systems directly at the protein level. DARPins binding to GFP or mCherry were selected by ribosome display. For GFP, binders with KD as low as 160 pM were obtained, while for mCherry the best affinity was 6 nM. We then verified in cell culture their specific binding in a complex cellular environment and found an affinity cut-off in the mid-nanomolar region, above which binding is no longer detectable in the cell. Next, their binding properties were employed to change the localization of the respective fluorescent proteins within cells. Finally, we performed experiments in Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio and utilized these DARPins to either degrade or delocalize fluorescently tagged fusion proteins in developing organisms, and to phenocopy loss-of-function mutations. Specific protein binders can thus be selected in vitro and used to reprogram developmental systems in vivo directly at the protein level, thereby bypassing some limitations of approaches that function at the DNA or the RNA level.},

	doi = {10.1038/369400a0},
	abstract = {Subcellular RNA localization in different cell types leads to asymmetric distribution of proteins in these cells. The localization of bicoid (bcd) messenger RNA to the anterior pole of the developing Drosophila oocyte gives rise in embryogenesis to a steep concentration gradient of the bcd protein, a transcription factor that activates expression of zygotic genes needed for anterior development. The exuperantia (exu) gene is necessary for this localization of bcd mRNA. Here we express a chimaeric gene encoding a fusion between the Acquorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the exu protein (Exu) in female germ cells, and find that the fusion protein fluoresces strongly in both live and fixed cells during Drosophila oogenesis. The fusion protein rescues an exu null allele, restoring full fertility to females, and is expressed and localized in a temporal and spatial pattern similar to native Exu. The high sensitivity of the GFP tag provides important new details on the subcellular localization of Exu. The fusion protein is found in particles concentrated at ring canals, where transport occurs between nurse cells and the oocyte. Drugs such as colchicine and taxol that affect microtubule stability alter localization of the particles. We propose that the particles are ribonucleoprotein complexes or vesicles which transport bcd mRNA along microtubules and target it to the anterior oocyte cortex.},

	issn = {0021-9525},
	abstract = {Dynamin is the mammalian homologue to the Drosophila shibire gene product. Mutations in this 100-kD GTPase cause a pleiotropic defect in endocytosis. To further investigate its role, we generated stable HeLa cell lines expressing either wild-type dynamin or a mutant defective in GTP binding and hydrolysis driven by a tightly controlled, tetracycline-inducible promoter. Overexpression of wild-type dynamin had no effect. In contrast, coated pits failed to become constricted and coated vesicles failed to bud in cells overexpressing mutant dynamin so that endocytosis via both transferrin (Tfn) and EGF receptors was potently inhibited. Coated pit assembly, invagination, and the recruitment of receptors into coated pits were unaffected. Other vesicular transport pathways, including Tfn receptor recycling, Tfn receptor biosynthesis, and cathepsin D transport to lysosomes via Golgi-derived coated vesicles, were unaffected. Bulk fluid-phase uptake also continued at the same initial rates as wild type. EM immunolocalization showed that membrane-bound dynamin was specifically associated with clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane. Dynamin was also associated with isolated coated vesicles, suggesting that it plays a role in vesicle budding. Like the Drosophila shibire mutant, HeLa cells overexpressing mutant dynamin accumulated long tubules, many of which remained connected to the plasma membrane. We conclude that dynamin is specifically required for endocytic coated vesicle formation, and that its GTP binding and hydrolysis activities are required to form constricted coated pits and, subsequently, for coated vesicle budding.},
